## 🌙 **About the Creator**

I’m drawn to the quiet spaces between imagination and reality — the places where ideas breathe before becoming form. Creating worlds, moods, and moments has always been my way of giving shape to that inner universe.  

Jumpino is one of those fragments — a small world built piece by piece, shaped for anyone willing to explore with patience and curiosity.
